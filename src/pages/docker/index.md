# Docker Deployment Tool

Cloud Docker for Commerce provides an option to deploy Adobe Commerce to a Docker environment for development, testing, and automation tasks. It includes the following features:

- **Cross-platform support**—Supports Linux, macOS and Windows with WSL2
- **Cloud emulation**–Provides a Cloud-like deployment pipeline and filesystem to test code locally before deploying your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure project to Staging or Production servers
- **Adobe Commerce development**—Creates a local development environment for On-premises projects
- **Multiple sync options**—Provides three file synchronization options: `native`, `mutagen`, and `manual-native`. The manual-native option provides the best performance on macOS and Windows.
- **Extensibility**—Use a standard Docker configuration file to extend and customize your development environment

## Host Operating Systems

The Cloud Docker environment supports Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. The containers should run on any Docker host, but some of the set up scripts require you to install PHP and Composer.
