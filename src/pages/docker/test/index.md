# Testing in Cloud Docker

It is a best practice to test your application thoroughly before launching the store website or contributing code to the Cloud tools repositories.

While in development, it is important to perform end-to-end functional testing on your Adobe Commerce project. See the following guidance for performing functional testing in the Docker environment:

- [Application testing](application-testing.md)—Use the Magento Functional Testing Framework (MFTF) for application testing in Cloud Docker environment.
- [Code testing](code-testing.md)—Use the Codeception testing framework for PHP for validating code that is intended for contribution to Cloud package repositories.
